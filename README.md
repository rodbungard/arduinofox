# arduinofox
This project is for Amateur radio operators that participate in "Fox Hunting" or Hidden radio direction finding.  I built my first Fox Box using the Byonics PicCon V3.  I found that controller to be buggy and was not happy at all with the price of it. 

WT4Y has a arduino fox controller project that I used as a guide for my controller.  I used a arduino mico pro, 1 resistor and a MIC/Speaker cable to make this.  I have it connected to a Baofeng radio.  See https://www.wt4y.com/arduino/arduino-fox-controller  for the code.  I modified the code to set XMIT = 0 after 1 time playing the tune and ID string.  I also change the tune it plays to make it my own.
